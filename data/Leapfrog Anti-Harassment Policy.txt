ethnicity, sex, language, region, ideology, tribe or similar other ground is prohibited and is considered as a punishable offense.

4.3 Sexual Harassment
According to Section 4 of the Sexual Harassment at Workplace Prevention Act, sexual harassment is defined as any of the following
unsolicited acts carried out or caused to be carried out by a person in violation of his or her authority or position, or as a result of the
imposition of duress, undue influence, or enticement:
1. Making sexual advances or physical contact
2. Displaying pornographic content
3. Expressing sexual intentions through writing, speaking, or nonverbal cues.
4. Request or suggestion for sexual favors
5. Harassing or flirting with a sexual intent.

5. Means of Harassment

Verbal harassment refers to the use of words, insults, or derogatory language to demean, belittle, or intimidate someone. Offensive
remarks, jokes, or slurs related to someone’s identity (gender, race, religion, etc.).
Repeatedly making comments about someone’s appearance or background that makes them uncomfortable.

5.2 Non-Verbal Harassment:

5.3 Physical Harassment:
Unwanted physical contact, such as touching.
Physical intimidation.

5.4 Cyber Harassment:

6. Reporting Mechanism
If you experience harassment or discrimination, you can report it through Leapfrog’s following Speak-up channels :
Harassment Reporting: Submit a written complaint including details, witnesses (if any), and supporting evidence via the Harassment
Reporting form.
Ask & Share Us Anything: The "Ask & Share Us Anything" form can also be used to report harassment cases to internal teams. Access
to the form is restricted to the People Management Lead and the SVP of Engineering & Operations, who will ensure confidentiality and
take appropriate action when needed. The People Management Lead and the SVP of Engineering & Operations shall promptly and
without delay escalate the complaint to the BoD by filling in the Harassment Reporting form.
Direct Reporting: Any employee who is a victim or who is aware that harassing conduct is prevailing can report harassment directly to
their Team Manager or any superiors. It’s the responsibility of the Team Manager and superiors to report the case to People
Management Lead and the SVP of Engineering & Operations. The People Management Lead and the SVP of Engineering & Operations
shall promptly and without delay escalate the complaint to the BoD by filling in the Harassment Reporting form.
If the accused is either SVP, People Management Lead, or the superior, you can skip the hierarchy and scan the QR, and submit the
complaint/report through the form.

7. Investigation Mechanism
Formal Investigation: Harassment complaints submitted through the Harassment Reporting form are directly received by Board of
Directors (BOD) members. Any harassment complaints received through other speak-up channels and authorities need to be also
escalated to the BoD.
Upon receiving a complaint, BoD appoints an external legal consultant to form an investigation committee composed of the designated
BoD members, external legal consultants, and, if any, internal team members. The “external legal consultant” must be a firm or
individual attorney who is rated “Tier One” in the Chamber and Partners Global rating. The external legal consultant in coordination with
the committee will then begin a formal investigation, which includes interviewing both the complainant and the accused, as well as
calling any witnesses and reviewing available evidence. This process must be carried out such that the investigation must be completed
within 12 days from the receipt of the complaint. The role of “internal team member” shall be limited to secretarial roles and liaising
between committee members.
For non-sexual harassment, the BoD may form an internal committee, with no need for an external legal consultant. In sexual
harassment cases, an external legal consultant will always be appointed.
Right to Fair Hearing: Both the complainant and the accused will have the right to present their side, provide evidence, and have a
representative if needed.
Report Submission: The external legal consultant will submit a report with findings and recommended actions within 12 days from the
date of receipt of the complaint.

8. Confidentiality
Protection of Information: All complaints, investigations, and associated proceedings will be kept strictly confidential. The identity of the
complainant, accused, and witnesses will not be disclosed to anyone other than the BoD and investigation committee.
Document Security: All investigation records will be securely stored and accessed only by BoD and the investigation committee.

9. Protection of the Complainant
No Adverse Action: The complainant will not face any adverse consequences, such as demotion, termination, or unfavorable work
conditions, for solely reporting harassment.

Interim Measures: If necessary, temporary arrangements like changing work shifts or locations will be made to ensure a safe working
environment while the investigation is ongoing.

10. Retaliation
Zero Tolerance for Retaliation: Any form of retaliation, such as intimidation, threats, demotion, or dismissal, against a complainant or
witness is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.
Reporting Retaliation: Employees facing retaliation can report it to the superior. Leapfrog will promptly investigate and take appropriate
actions.

11. Response and Resolution
Corrective Actions: Depending on the severity of the offense, actions may include counseling, written warnings, suspension, or
termination.
Resolution Timeline: The entire process should be concluded within 14 days of the reporting of the harassment.

12. Conciliation
Voluntary Conciliation: A harassment complaint can be resolved through conciliation provided that both parties consent to a
conciliation effort.
Confidential Agreement: If conciliation is successful, the terms of the settlement will remain confidential.

13. Expectations from Employees
Professional Conduct: All employees are expected to maintain a respectful and professional work environment, free from harassment
of any kind.
Bystander Responsibility: Employees witnessing harassment must report it to the superior. Bystanders play a crucial role in preventing
workplace harassment.

14. Prevention and Awareness
Regular Training: The company will conduct mandatory training sessions on sexual harassment prevention and employee rights under
the Nepal Labour Act 2017.
Policy Communication: All employees will receive a copy of this policy, and it will be included in the company's Knowledge
Management System, Confluence.
Workplace Culture: Managers and team leads are expected to foster a culture of respect and openness to ensure employees feel safe
and heard.

15. Disciplinary Action
Consequences for Offenders: Based on the investigation's outcome, disciplinary action may include verbal or written warnings,
suspension, demotion, or termination. Serious offenses may lead to legal action.
False Complaints: If an investigation reveals that the complaint was maliciously fabricated, the complainant may face disciplinary
action. However, this may not apply to cases where complaints are unproven due to insufficient evidence.

16. Additional Clauses
Support for Victims: The company will offer counseling services or external professional help for employees impacted by harassment.

Post-Incident Monitoring: The investigation committee will follow up with both the complainant and the accused after the case's
resolution to ensure no further issues arise.
Periodic Review: The policy will be reviewed annually to reflect changes in law or workplace dynamics.

17. Legal Framework
This policy is developed in alignment with the Nepal Labour Act 2017 and other relevant legal provisions, including the Sexual
Harassment at Workplace Prevention Act, 2015. Any conflicts between this policy and the law will default to the legal provisions.
